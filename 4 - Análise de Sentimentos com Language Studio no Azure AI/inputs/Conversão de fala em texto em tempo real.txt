Stupid Cupid. You're a real mean guy. I got to clip your way so you can't fly. I'm in love and it's a crying shame, and I know that you're the one that blames Hey, hey, set me free. Stupid you big stop pigging on me. I can't do my homework and I can't be straight. I need them every. Hey, set me free, stupid Cupid. Stop picking on me. You mixed me up with good. I'm a very star. Ain't ghostly Robin Hood with somebody else's heart.
